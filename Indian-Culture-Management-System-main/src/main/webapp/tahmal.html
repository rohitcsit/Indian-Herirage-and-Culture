            <p>The Taj Mahal is one of the most iconic and renowned landmarks in the world. It is located in Agra, a city in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India</p>
            <h2>Historical Significance:</h2>
            <p>The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth in 1631. The construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and was completed in 1648. It is often referred to as a symbol of eternal love and is considered one of the most beautiful architectural creations in the world.</p>
            <h2>Architectural Marvel:</h2>
            <p>The Taj Mahal is a masterpiece of Mughal architecture, blending elements from Islamic, Persian, and Indian architectural styles. It's primarily made of white marble and is adorned with intricate inlays of semi-precious stones and calligraphy from the Quran. The main building is flanked by a large garden, reflecting pools, and several smaller structures, all of which contribute to its grandeur.</p>
            <h2>Structure and Layout:</h2>
            <p>The main structure consists of a central white marble mausoleum with a large central dome and four minarets. The central dome is surrounded by four smaller domes, creating a harmonious and symmetrical design. The minarets are tilted slightly outward to protect the main mausoleum in case of an earthquake.</p>
            <h2>Garden and Water Features:</h2>
            <p>The Taj Mahal stands at the end of a long, formal garden with a raised reflecting pool that aligns perfectly with the mausoleum. The garden is divided into 16 flowerbeds, each with a unique design. Fountains and canals add to the beauty of the garden and create a serene atmosphere.</p>
            <h2>Cultural and UNESCO World Heritage Site:</h2>
            <p>In 1983, the Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognizing its cultural and historical significance. It attracts millions of tourists from around the world, making it one of the most visited landmarks globally.</p>
            <h2>Conservation and Preservation:</h2>
            <p>Due to the impact of environmental pollution and heavy visitor footfall, there have been concerns about the Taj Mahal's yellowing and deteriorating marble. The Indian government has taken steps to mitigate these effects by restricting certain industrial activities in the vicinity and implementing measures to reduce pollution.</p>
            <h2>Festivals and Events:</h2>
            <p>The Taj Mahal remains an integral part of Indian culture and is often illuminated during special events and festivals, such as Diwali and Independence Day. It's a symbol of national pride and unity.</p>
