            <p>Bibi ka Maqbara, often referred to as the "Mini Taj" or "Dakkhni Taj," is a historical monument located in the city of Aurangabad in the Indian state of Maharashtra. It is an architectural homage to the famous Taj Mahal in Agra and serves as the tomb of Dilras Banu Begum, the wife of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. </p>
            <h2>Historical Significance:</h2>
            <p>Bibi ka Maqbara was commissioned in the late 17th century by Prince Azam Shah, the son of Emperor Aurangzeb, as a tribute to his mother, Dilras Banu Begum. It was constructed between 1651 and 1661.</p>
            <h2>Architectural Style:</h2>
            <p>The monument is an example of Mughal architecture, with a distinct influence of the Persian architectural style. While it bears a resemblance to the Taj Mahal, it is much simpler and less ornate in comparison. The monument is constructed using locally quarried basalt rock and plaster, which gives it a different appearance from the white marble of the Taj Mahal.</p>
            <h2>Structure and Layout:</h2>

            <h2>Differences from the Taj Mahal:</h2>

Bibi ka Maqbara, though inspired by the Taj, has a simpler and less intricate design.</p>
            <h2>Cultural and Tourist Attraction:</h2>
            <p>The monument is a popular tourist destination and a symbol of cultural heritage in Aurangabad. It attracts visitors interested in Mughal history, architecture, and art.</p>
