            <p>Gol Gumbaz is a historic mausoleum located in Bijapur (also known as Vijayapura), in the Indian state of Karnataka. This imposing architectural wonder is the final resting place of Sultan Mohammed Adil Shah of the Adil Shahi Dynasty and is celebrated for its massive dome, intricate architecture, and acoustic marvels.</p>
            <h2>Historical Significance:</h2>
            <p>Gol Gumbaz was built in the 17th century and is the tomb of Sultan Mohammed Adil Shah (r. 1627-1656) and his family.

            <h2>Architectural Marvel:</h2>

Under this dome, there is a unique acoustic wonder known as the "Whispering Gallery." If you stand at one end of the gallery and whisper, your voice can be clearly heard at the opposite end, about 37 meters away. This acoustic phenomenon is attributed to the architecture of the gallery.</p>
