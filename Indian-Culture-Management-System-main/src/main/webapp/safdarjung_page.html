            <p>The Safdarjung Tomb is a sandstone and marble structure featuring a large central dome and four smaller domes at its corners. The central dome is surrounded by a beautiful garden, Mughal-style charbagh, which is divided into four squares by pathways and features fountains and ornamental plants.</p>
            <h2>Cultural and Tourist Attraction:</h2>
            <p>Efforts have been made to preserve and restore the Safdarjung Tomb over the years to ensure that its historical and architectural value is maintained.</p>

            <br>
            <P>The Safdarjung Tomb is not only a historical monument but also a place where visitors can appreciate the architectural beauty and historical significance of the Mughal era in India.
